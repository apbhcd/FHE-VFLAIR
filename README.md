 ![Overview](usage_guidance/figures/overview.png)
## Basic Introduction

  VFLAIR is a general, extensible and light-weight VFL framework that provides vanilar VFL training and evaluation process simulation alonging with several effective communication improvement methods as well as attack and defense evaluations considering data safety and privacy. Aside from NN serving as local models for VFL systems, tree-based VFL is also supported.

  * VFLAIR provides simulation of the vanilar VFL process containing forward local model prediction transmits, backward gradient transmits as well as local and global model updates.
  * **FedBCD** ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9855231/)) is provided for improving the effectiveness of VFL training process.
  * Four attack types are included in VFLAIR as examples for training-decoupled attack and training-time attack separately. In each attack type, multiple attack is available for use:
      * **Label Inference(LI)** 
          * Batch-level Label Inference ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833321/))/Direct Label Inference ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833321/))
          * Norm-based Scoring (NS) ([paper]([[2102.08504\] Label Leakage and Protection in Two-party Split Learning (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08504)))/Direction-based Scoring (DS) ([paper]([[2102.08504\] Label Leakage and Protection in Two-party Split Learning (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08504)))
          * Passive Model Completion (PMC) ([paper]([Label Inference Attacks Against Vertical Federated Learning | USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/fu-chong)))/Active Model Completion (AMC) ([paper]([Label Inference Attacks Against Vertical Federated Learning | USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/fu-chong)))
      * **Feature Reconstruction(FR)**
          * Generative Regression Network (GRN)([paper]([[2010.10152\] Feature Inference Attack on Model Predictions in Vertical Federated Learning (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10152)))
          * Training-based Back Mapping by model inversion (TBM)([paper]([[2205.04007v1\] ResSFL: A Resistance Transfer Framework for Defending Model Inversion Attack in Split Federated Learning (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04007v1)))
      * **Targeted Backdoor(TB)**
          *  Label replacement Backdoor ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833321/)) 
      * **Non-Targeted Backdoor(NTB)**
          * Noisy-Sample Backdoor (NSB)([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833321/)) 
          * Missing Feature (MF)([paper]([Liu2021.pdf (neurips2021workshopfl.github.io)](https://neurips2021workshopfl.github.io/NFFL-2021/papers/2021/Liu2021.pdf))) 
  * Several basic defense methods as well as emerging defense strategies are provided in VFLAIR and can be flexibly applied in VFL training and testing flow. Defense methods provided in VFLAIR is listed below. Detail information of these defenses are included in `/src/configs/README.md`.
    * **Differentail Privacy (Laplace-DP and Gaussian-DP)** ([paper](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Theory_and_Applications_of_Models_of_Com/JHFqCQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover))
    * **Gradient Sparsification (GS)** ([paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkhQHMW0W))
    * **Confusional AutoEncoder (CAE) & DiscreteSGD enhanced CAEï¼ˆDCAE)** ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833321/))
    * **Mutual Information regularization Defense(MID)** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01142))
    * **GradPerturb(GPer)** ([paper]([[2203.02073\] Differentially Private Label Protection in Split Learning (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02073)))
    * **Distance Correlation(dCor)** ([paper]([[2203.01451\] Label Leakage and Protection from Forward Embedding in Vertical Federated Learning (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01451)))
  * Multiple datasets are provided along with VFLAIR.
  * Defense Capability Score ——a comprehensive metric for assessing defense ability is also introduced.
  * Tree-based VFL is also proved in the code with XGBoost and RandomForest supported. See `./src/configs/README_TREE.md` for detailed description.

## Quick Start

### Zero. Environment Preparation

  Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary requirements.

### One. Basic Benchmark Usage: A Quick Example

1. Customize your own configurations

* Create a json file for your own evaluation configuration in `/src/configs` folder. Name it whatever you want, like `my_configs.json`.
* `/src/configs/basic_configs.json` is a sample configuration file. You can copy it and modify the contents for your own purpose.
* For detail information about configuration parameters, see `/src/configs/README.md` for detail information.

2. Use `cd src` and `python main_separate.py --seed 0 --gpu 0 --configs <Your_Config_file_name>` to start the evaluation process. A quick example can be launched by simplying using `cd src` and `python main_separate.py` (a vanilar VFL training and testing process is launched). For more detail descriptions, see Section Two.

### Two. Advanced Usage: Implement Your Own Algorithm

- How to add new attack/defense?
  - `usage_guidance/Add_New_Evaluation.md`
- Dataset Usage?
  - `usage_guidance/Dataset_Usage.md`
- How to write Configuration files and how to specify hyper-parameters for evaluation?
  - `src/config/README.md` and `src/config/README_TREE.md`
- What is Defense Capability Score (DCS)?
  - Refer to `src/metrics` for details.
